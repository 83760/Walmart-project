Some of the Product category like 19,20,13 have very less purchase. Company can think of dropping it.

The top 10 users who have purchased more, company should give more offers and discounts so that they can be retained and can be helpful for companies business.

The occupation which are contributing more company can think of offering credit cards or other benefits to those customers by liasing with some financial partners to increase the sales.

People who are staying in city for an year have contributed to 35% of the total purchase amount. Company can focus on such customer base who are neither too old nor too new residents in the city.

We have highest frequency of purchase order between 5k and 10k, company can focus more on these mid range products to increase the sales.

## Question:
1. Are women spending more money per transaction than men? Why or Why not?
Ans: No. CI's of male and female do not overlap and upper limits of female purchase CI are lesser than lower limits of male purchase CI. This proves that men usually spend more than women (NOTE: as per data 77% contibutions are from men and only 23% purchases are from women).

The reason for less purchase by women could have several factors: Males might be doing the purchase for females. Salary can be a factor in less purchase. We also need to see whether male-based products were sold more than women-based products to clearly identify difference in spending pattern. If the female based products quality/quantity needs to be improved for women purchasing.

2. Confidence intervals and distribution of the mean of the expenses by female and male customers.
At 99% Confidence Interval with sample size 1000 Average amount spend by male customers lie in the range 9,23,466.52 - 9,28,700.27 Average amount spend by female customers lie in range 7,10,606.4 - 7,14,831.56

3. Are confidence intervals of average male and female spending overlapping? How can Walmart leverage this conclusion to make changes or improvements?
Ans: No. Confidence intervals of average male and female spending are not overlapping. This trend can be changed via introducing female centric marketing strategies by Walmart so that more female customers are attracted to increase female purchases to achieve comparable statistics close to 50%.
